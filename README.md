Wine Quality Prediction
This project uses machine learning techniques to predict the quality of wine based on its chemical properties. 
The dataset used for this project comes from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. 
The wine quality is rated on a scale from 0 to 10, and our goal is to classify or predict this quality using various features.

Project Overview
This project explores different machine learning algorithms to build a predictive model for wine quality based on physiochemical properties. We evaluate the performance of algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting to determine the most effective method.

Dataset
The dataset consists of two types of wine:

Red Wine
White Wine

Each dataset contains the following 12 features (input variables):

Fixed acidity
Volatile acidity
Citric acid
Residual sugar
Chlorides
Free sulfur dioxide
Total sulfur dioxide
Density
pH
Sulphates
Alcohol
Quality (target variable)

Technologies
Python 3.9+
Jupyter Notebook
Pandas - Data manipulation and analysis
Scikit-learn - Machine learning algorithms
Matplotlib/Seaborn - Data visualization
NumPy - Numerical computations

Installation
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/karmanyas/Wine-Quality-Prediction.git

Navigate into the project directory:
cd Wine-Quality-Prediction

Install the necessary dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Open and run the Jupyter notebook Wine_Quality_Prediction.ipynb to explore the data and build machine learning models.
You can train and evaluate different machine learning models to predict wine quality.
Model Performance
After training and evaluating various models, the best performing model (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) achieved an accuracy of around X% on the test data.
